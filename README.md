# op3ndott_fitband
Tesco Op3nDott Fitband stuff

The schematic is produced by reverse engineering of the Op3nDott (Tesco)
Fitband.

This document is not intended for using as a documentation for producion. It
does not cover the whole origial design rather it can be used to understand the
system for those who want to write their own firmware. It most probably
contains all necessary connections and buses. It does not contains for example
the RF network since it is unimportant from firmware point of view and would be
hard to explore.

In case of some parts it was not possible to figure out the part number (for
example the accelerometer, the motor, the transistors). In these cases I just
picked up someting similar from the schematic capture software.

Reference numbers are not related to the original design at all.

The board has four layers. There are signal lines on the inner layers.
